        <h3>And Then There Were None</h3>
          <h5>Agatha Christie </h4>
            <p> From acclaimed mystery author Agatha Christie, And Then There Were None is a mastery of tension. A
              quirky millionaire hosts a gathering of eight strangers on a private island off of the English coast. When
              the guests arrive, the elusive host is nowhere to be found. In his place, however, is the accusation of
              murder upon each of the guests.

              As panic sets in, those brought to the island begin to die one by one. Paranoia sets in and sense unravels
              as the body count mounts. It’s a classic whodunnit that has readers standing up and screaming, “What?!”
              until the very last page.

        <h3>Alice's Adventures in Wonderland</h3>
          <h5>Lewis Carroll</h4>
            <p> In this quintessential novel, seven-year-old Alice stumbles down a rabbit hole into a fantastical world
              of wonder and trouble. While navigating this new and peculiar place, Alice encounters many enchanting
              anthropomorphic creatures, like the iconic White Rabbit and the Cheshire Cat. Carrol’s work twists logic
              and spins riddles, giddily tossing convention aside. Now one of the cornerstones of the fantasy genre,
              Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland holds a dear place in the hearts of both children and adults.
